//! Rust port of vendor/doomgeneric/d_iwad.c.
//!
//! IWAD discovery and selection. An IWAD (Internal WAD) is the primary game
//! data file (e.g. `doom.wad`, `doom2.wad`). This module maintains a table of
//! known IWADs, searches a list of candidate directories to locate one on
//! disk, and identifies which game mission and mode a found IWAD belongs to.
//!
//! Differences from the C original:
//! - `BuildIWADDirList` adds only the current directory (`"."`), omitting the
//!   `DOOMWADDIR`/`DOOMWADPATH` environment-variable paths and the
//!   platform-specific Windows registry / Unix standard paths that the full
//!   Chocolate Doom implementation supports. The `ORIGCODE` conditional in the
//!   C source guards those paths; this port permanently takes the simplified
//!   branch and hardcodes `FILES_DIR` as `"."`.
//! - `D_CheckCorrectIWAD` is intentionally a no-op (matches the C original's
//!   empty stub in doomgeneric).
