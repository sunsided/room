//! Rust port of vendor/doomgeneric/f_finale.c.
//!
//! Game completion, final screen animation.
//!
//! Handles three distinct finale stages driven by the `FinaleStage` enum:
//! scrolling text printed character-by-character over a flat background
//! (`Text`), a full-screen art image with optional bunny scroll (`ArtScreen`),
//! and the cast-of-characters roll (`Cast`) used at the end of Doom II.
//! Episode/map matching is performed against the `TEXTSCREENS` table to
//! select the appropriate text string and background flat.
//!
//! Notable Rust-vs-C differences:
//! - Episode/map dispatch uses a `for` loop over `TEXTSCREENS` instead of
//!   a series of `if`/`else if` blocks.
//! - The C `goto stopattack` in `F_CastTicker` is refactored into the helper
//!   `goto_stopattack`.
//! - `FinaleStage` replaces the bare `finalestage` integer, improving
//!   exhaustiveness checking in `match` expressions.
//! - Finale text strings and cast names that the C source takes from
//!   `d_englsh.h` are inlined as `const` C-string literals.
