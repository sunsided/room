//! Rust port of vendor/doomgeneric/i_video.c.
//!
//! Video output shim: allocates the palette-indexed `I_VideoBuffer`,
//! expands it through the gamma-corrected palette into BGRA
//! `DG_ScreenBuffer` on `I_FinishUpdate`, and forwards calls to the
//! platform layer.
//!
//! The C source supports two compile-time paths: an 8-bit `CMAP256`
//! direct-blit and a 16/32-bit framebuffer path. Only the latter is
//! ported here. The `s_Fb` structure tracks pixel layout chosen at
//! init time via `-gfxmode rgba8888|rgb565`; `cmap_to_fb` /
//! `cmap_to_rgb565` perform the conversion from palette indices to
//! the chosen format. Many of the stub entry points
//! (`I_BeginRead`, `I_BindVideoVariables`, ...) exist purely to
//! satisfy the engine's call sites without doing any work on the
//! generic platform.
